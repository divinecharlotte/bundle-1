# bundle-1

###

- Create a project & initialize git(from my github account)
- Rename your main branch from `master` to `main`(my default branch is set to main)
- Make changes to the project (updated this readme)
- Stage your changes and commit them(did git add .)
- Create a github repo and connect it with your project(cloned this repo from this (link)[https://github.com/divinecharlotte/bundle-1.git])
- Push your changes to github(did git push )
- Create a new branch `dev`(git checkout -b dev)
- From `dev` create another branch `test`(checked out to dev branch and created test from it)
- Go back to the `dev` branch and delete the `test` branch
